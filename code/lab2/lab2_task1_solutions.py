""" Lab 2 Task 1: Gini Impurity and Gini Gain

implement it as a simple python function to find the Gini index and gini gain,
then test it using the toy example we used in the lecture.


gini_impurity_numba and gini_impurity_numpy(counts: np.ndarray) -> float
these are simple functions that compute the Gini impurity given class counts. They 
are applicable to a single node (parent or child). It is unlikely there will be much 
speed difference here, because numpy is efficient at these operations.

gini_gain_numba and gini_gain_numpy(attr: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> float:
These take a single attribute, split the class variable y by the attribute values, 
then call gini_impurity on the parent and children to compute the Gini gain. 

The numpy version uses np functions np.unique and np.bincount.
https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html
https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html
    v_vals, inv_v = np.unique(attr, return_inverse=True)
recovers the unique attribute values v_vals (length v) and their encoding for each 
case: inv_v is an array of length n. 
    c_vals, inv_c = np.unique(y,    return_inverse=True)
does the same for the class labels y, giving c_vals (length c) and inv_c (length n).

The more confusing line is this to form the contingency table. 
    # Counts per value
    counts_v  = np.bincount(inv_v, minlength=k)
gives the number of cases per attribute value (k is the number of unique attribute 
values).  we want the counts per (value, class) pair in a 2D array of shape (k, c). 
With a loop, assuming we map onto 0...k-1 and 0...v-1, this would be:
# counts_vc[v, cls] = number of samples with attr value v and class cls
counts_vc = np.zeros((k, c), dtype=int)
for i in range(n):
    counts_vc[inv_v[i], inv_c[i]] += 1   
But loops are bad in python. Instead,The trick is to use numpy bincount again on a 
flattened 1D index. We create a new index that shows exactly which cell each element 
belongs to. This is called a row major mapping of 2D to 1D. Class index (inv_c) gives 
the column, and the row is inv_v, which we need to scale by c (the number of columns) 
    pair_idx  = inv_v * c + inv_c
We then count how many are in each of these cells using bincount, and reshape back to 
shape(k,c) 
    counts_vc = np.bincount(pair_idx, minlength=k * c).reshape(k, c)
this may seem over complex, but it is very efficient in numpy and is a common pattern
in Python.

The numba version just uses loops throughout.
