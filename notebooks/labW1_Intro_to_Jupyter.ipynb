    "# Lab Week 1 -- Introduction to Jupyter Notebook Environment for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to familiarise with the Jupyter Notebook environment and specific Python constructs for Machine Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we have students with very diverse programming backgrounds and levels. This lab is designed for you to go at your own pace. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those of you familiar with other scientific programming environments like MATLAB, Octave or R may recognise the style of working. Those of you that have only programmed in the context of Software Engineering, read this quote from Fernando PÃ©rez, creator of IPython, a foundational block of Jupyter Notebooks: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"A literate computing environment is one that allows users not only to execute commands but also to store in a literate document format the results of these commands along with figures and free-form text that can include formatted mathematical expressions. In practice it can be seen as a blend of a command-line environment such as the Unix shell with a word processor, since the resulting documents can be read like text, but contain blocks of code that were executed by the underlying computational system\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is comprised of cells, that can be of type Markdown. Cells can be executed using the \"Run\" button on the top. If the cell is of type Markdown, Jupyter will convert it into text. We won't be getting into details with Markdowns in this tutorial. Read this external resource later for a full explanation on how to write Markdown cells https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell is of type code, when you press \"Run\" the code you wrote is passed to a Python interpreter that executes it, showing you any result. Contrary to running a Python script on a shell or IDE, variables that you create in the cell are held in memory so you can use them in subsequent cells. This is memory-expensive, but allows the implementation of \"literate computing\" which is very helpful in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning.\n",

Don't be afraid of adding and deleting cells as you wish (except of course those that have the rest of the tutorial ;), this will help you getting to grips with the Notebook environment.\n",

    "If you are a complete newbie to python, start from the Python Syntax section and work your way up to Python Arrays. Then, read Python Iterators and Python Math. In the context of Basic Machine learning, we won't be creating our own classes or extending them as in Software Engineering, in that regard you only need to be comfortable creating instances of classes of pre-defined libraries and calling their methods. We will show examples of that in the following sections\n",

    "To solve this problem, numpy introduces the concept of **broadcasting**, i.e.,  the process of reshaping an array of smaller size to make it compatible for operations with arrays of higher dimensions.  You can then conveniently apply the operation on arrays of some shapes that are strictly speaking incompatible, and numpy will take care behind the scenes as efficiently as possible.\n",

Also, in some occasions the application of broadcasting is less efficient, so you may need to test which of the two approaches is more efficient. Finally, convenience is sometimes at odds with readability of the code, especially when operating at higher dimensions    \n",
